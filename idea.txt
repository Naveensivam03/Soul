Here’s your **7-day Anima AI execution plan** — compressed, surgical, and efficient. You’ll have a **fully working memory-based AI companion** in **7 days**, ready for demo or expansion.

# 🧠 **Anima AI — 7-Day Hardcore Build Plan**

## ✅ **Day 1: Speech-to-Text + Sentiment**

**Goal**: Capture speech → text → emotional metadata

* Use **Whisper** (or OpenAI API) for speech-to-text.
* Run sentiment analysis (`distilbert-sst2` or similar).
* Save:

  ```json
  {
    "text": "...",
    "sentiment": "positive",
    "date": "2025-06-15",
    "source": "speech"
  }
  ```
* Prepare for embedding next.

---

## ✅ **Day 2: Embedding + Vector DB**

**Goal**: Turn input into memory (vector + metadata)

* Use `sentence-transformers` to create embeddings.
* Set up **FAISS** (or Chroma) as vector DB.
* Store vector with metadata from Day 1.

---

## ✅ **Day 3: RAG Memory Retrieval + LLM Response**

**Goal**: Create meaningful replies using memory

* On new user input:

  * Convert to embedding
  * Search FAISS for top-5 similar entries
  * Format: `[Relevant past memories + current query]`
* Use GPT-4o or any LLM to respond.

---

## ✅ **Day 4: Text-to-Speech Output**

**Goal**: Respond like a human friend

* Use **Coqui TTS**, Bark, or Google TTS
* Input: LLM response text
* Output: Play audio voice reply

---

## ✅ **Day 5: Integrate Pipeline End-to-End**

**Goal**: Wire it all together

* Flow:

  1. **Voice Input**
  2. **STT → Sentiment → Embedding → Store**
  3. **New Query → Retrieve → LLM Response**
  4. **TTS Output**
* Create a script or CLI to test full interaction.

---

## ✅ **Day 6: Memory Filtering + Retrieval Enhancements**

**Goal**: Smarter memory search

* Add filters: by **date**, **sentiment**, or **topic keyword**

* Enable user to ask:

  > “What did I say when I was sad last week?”

* Improve embedding search logic (cosine similarity, re-ranking)

---

## ✅ **Day 7: UI + Personalization**

**Goal**: Make it feel alive and *yours*

* Build a **basic Streamlit/Flask app** or CLI interface
* Show:

  * Conversation history
  * Sentiment log
  * Personal profile memory (name, interests)
* Add: ability to **correct info** and update memory

---

# 💡 At the End of 7 Days

You’ll have an AI that:

* Listens
* Feels your mood
* Remembers everything you say
* Understands past conversations
* Speaks back with empathy and context
